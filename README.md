## Night Mode Conflict Resolution:
NM uses a unique method of patching into Anki that causes problem for ALL addons. Just make sure it loads last after all other addons have been loaded by changing it's folder name with a 'z' prefix. z828472. Or change this addon's folder name with an 'a' prefix a536247578. But changing folder names will prevent updates notifications, so it is far better to change nightmode as it screws up all other addons.
